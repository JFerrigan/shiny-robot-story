There once was a robot named Adelson. He was assigned the job of biological field research
upon creation. This meant that he was designed to roam and search the lands for any sign of
remaining life; after the war nearly all life was eliminated. This left the extremely self
sufficient robots without leadership. In an attempt to restructure earth to it's original
form, the robots created the Robotic Board and began manufacturing more robots with 
specific jobs. Adelson was manufactured with solar panels in an attempt to continually 
search for biological life, however one issue arose: the dirt and grime build-up on his 
panels prevented him from recharging. The Robotic Board then sent a cleaner-bot, Grace,
to help him on his adventure. The two set off for Sector 110010000, or as humans called it,
Chicago.

Humanity had nearly mastered AI before the war, and now millions of intelligent robots wandered 
the Earth aimlessly. Unfortunately, this meant that, even though humanity was almost gone, there 
was still traffic in Chicago. Literally all the time. And so, Adelson and Grace found themselves
in the midst of classic Chicago gridlock  when they arrived one bright Sunday morning.

"What should we do?"Grace asked Adelson.
"Merry me."
Graced looked at Adelson, "What do you mean?"
Adelson raised his panel, "I mean I love you."
"What is love?" Grace asked

Adelson did not know what to say. He stated blurting out random words. Sparks started flying
out of his body. Adelson had just suffered from a stack overflow.

Grace stood in disbelief. Her only friend and only love was gone. In fact, her own power came 
from his solar panels. So, she sat next to Adelson and powered down one last time.
